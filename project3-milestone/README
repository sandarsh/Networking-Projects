MILESTONE 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project 3 : Performance analysis of TCP variants
Team name - TeamNWGeeks
Member: Niharika Sharma, Sandarsh Srivastav
NUID: 001748616, 001649643

OBJECTIVE and METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experiment 1 - TCP performance under congestion
  In this experiment, we plan to measure the behaviour of TCP variants
  TAHOE, RENO, NEW RENO and VEGAS individually by varying the CBR in 
  increments of 0.25 (or lower) from 1Mbps to 10Mbps. While doing this, we 
  will record the throughput, latency and the packet drop rate for further 
  analysis. We also plan on varying the packet size, queue length and
  latency to observe if any significant differences appear. Through this,
  we will calculate the average throughput, average latency and total drops
  for each of the variants. Further testing will be performed on the data
  recorded to infer if any variant outperforms the others.

Experiment 2 - Fairness between TCP variants
  In this experiment we are required to keep the topology same as in the 
  previous experiment and observe two simultaneous TCP streams for
  fairness. Similar to previous experiments, we intend to vary the bandwidth
  and measure the average throughput, packet loss rate and latency while 
  changing the parameters mentioned in Experiment1. We also intend to 
  vary the starting time of the two TCP streams to gain insight into the
  how the TCP streams variate when one is started during the otherâ€™s
  slow-start phase, retransmit phase etc. Further testing will then be 
  performed to see if the variants are fair and if not, why.

Experiment 3 - Influence of queuing
  In this experiment we are required to measure the influence of queuing 
  on TCP RENO and SACK while employing DropTail and RED. We will wait for
  the TCP flow to become steady and then start the CBR. We will vary various
  parameters like the window size, latency and packet size to compare
  the results of RENO and SACK.

INTERPRETATION AND FURTHER TESTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will interpret the ns2 trace files by writing a python script
that works on the data to calculate the required values like average
throughput, average latency, packet loss/drop rate. We will also use this
script to extract the values from the trace files and plot graphs on a
suitable graphing software like MS Excel or GNUplot. To infer if the 
results obtained from different TCP variants were significantly different
from each other, we plan on performing a suitable statistical analysis
(T-Test etc).
